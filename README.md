1. üß† WTF IS THIS PROJECT?
This is a secure file upload microservice built in Go (Gin) that:

Accepts file uploads.

Stores them in AWS S3 (or compatible blob storage).

Uses PostgreSQL to track uploaded metadata.

Uses Redis for background jobs like email notifications or queues.

Runs Cron jobs to periodically clean old files.

Is fully dockerized, TDD-ready, and infra-capable.

üí• Basically, this is a backend-only project that simulates how real-world production systems manage files:

Secure access.

Authenticated uploads.

Background tasks.

Periodic cleanups.

Infra automation (Docker + cron + graceful shutdown).
